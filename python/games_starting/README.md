Games of Chance
Overview

This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project youâ€™ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.
Project Goals

You will work to write several functions that simulate games of chance. Each one of these functions will use a number of parameters, random number generation, conditionals, and return statements.
